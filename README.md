# ReplaceRICO

Fix broken 'white box' RICO assets that occurs when removing the PloppableRICO mod from your mod list.

Queries every building on the map, checks if the prefab is invalid, if so it replaces the prefab with its corresponding vanilla version.

I'd reccomend having Plop the Growables installed. I haven't tested, but without it I suspect the newly replaced buildings might complain about zoning.

## How to use

	1. Install via paradox mods
	
	2. Load broken save file
	
	3. Run replacer with Ctrl+b. After it has finished, save world as a new file (or alternatively backup the save before running).
	
	4. Exit to main menu and reload.
	
	5. Uninstall this mod.
